// This is the program to sort an array that contains 0 and 1 only.
//First we are goint to take an empty array and will make a function and pass the given array as arguments and run a loop.
// Afterwards we will compare each element of the array wiht 0 and if true push it into the empty array.
// Now where the loop is ending create another loop and and push the 1 in the same way by which it will put the element on same index
//at which the previous loop was stopped and thus will retain the value.
// Thus return empty.
